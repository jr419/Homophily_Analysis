# Homophily_Analysis
The goal of this project is to provide a groundwork for explaing the effect of homophily on Graph Neural Networks Performace, that leverages on recent results in random family networks and their geodesics, by exploring the structual effects of homophily. This is part of my Master's Dissertation Project.
